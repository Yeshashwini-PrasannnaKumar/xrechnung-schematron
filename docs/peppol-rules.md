# PEPPOL Rules into the XRechnung German National Ruleset and vice versa

## Introduction

This document outlines the process of integrating PEPPOL rules into the XRechnung German national ruleset and vice versa. The integration is facilitated through an automatic transformation initiated by an Ant build script which uses files generated by the transformation script located in the `src/xsl` folder. Notably, CII rules, while integrated, come with a warning status, given they're unofficially supported by PEPPOL.
Additionally, a snippet with the German national ruleset for integration into PEPPOL can be generated using a transformation script located in the tools directory.

```

## Executing the integration xr to peppol

For the XR to PEPPOL integration, the relevant target is `merge-peppol-rules-with-xr-rules` in the Ant build script. Execute the transformation with the following command:

```bash
ant merge-peppol-rules-with-xr-rules
```

In many instances, this transformation gets triggered through the `test` target.

## Executing the transformation peppol to xr

The `transform-xr-rules-to-peppol-nrs` target within the Ant build script facilitates the transformation from PEPPOL to XR. To run this transformation, directly invoke the target using the command:

```bash
ant transform-xr-rules-to-peppol-nrs
```

However, it is typically initiated by the `test` target, which is also invoked by other targets.
